Presentations:

Following are a few presentations. You can download them from the “Latest Thinking” section from my blog: asiliconvalleyinsider.com.

Cross Platform Mobile Development Tools
Every mobile platform has its own development environment: BlackBerry (Java and C/C++), iOS (Objective C), and Android (Dalvik Java). Fortunately for developers, there are a few alternatives. Some tools can wrap existing HTML into native libraries such as PhoneGap or even generate native code from existing HTML such as Appcelerator.


IP Security (IPSec)
IDS is dead. Welcome IDP. IPSec is dead. Welcome SSL. Well, history repeats itself. IDS and IDP are two different technologies for two different applications. The same is true for IPSec and SSL. IPSec provides data privacy at the network layer. SSL provides data privacy at the application layer. There will always be the need for an enterprise network to have IPSec and SSL to co-exist like there is for IDS and IDP. 


Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
MPLS emerged as a traffic engineering technology to optimize traffic loads on the Internet backbone by distributed loads evenly in the backbone. An ingress system shares its transit load across multiple paths. With more and more functions, features and applications being developed by the IETF and the MPLS forum, MPLS is enabling a new range of applications beyond traffic engineering: Differentiated Services, Layer 2 VPNs/VPLS, Layer 3 VPNs/BGP MPLS, Multi Service transport for Ethernet/Frame/ATM. 


Generalized MPLS (G-MPLS)
G-MPLS initial goal was to facilitate the required interaction between the IP and optical domains by extending MPLS traffic engineering for optical networks. Now, G-MPLS aims to create a universal control plane for dynamic provisioning and restoration of optical transport networks and will be key for the architecture of future core optical networks evolving towards meshes of DWDM transport systems connecting Optical and Photonic Switches (OXC/PXC).


The Communication Industry
The communication industry is moving to an horizontal integration like the computing industry did in the early 90s. The impact of the 1996 Telecom Act and the Internet are causing a destruction of the overall market value of the industry. Traditional Telecom Services are competing with the Internet, and Wireline Services are competing with Wireless Services.


The Internet Security and Intrusion Detection System Markets
Although corporations agree that Internet security should be one of the enabling technologies for the business use of the Net, the market has still not taken off. Why? What are the market dynamics in Intrusion Detection, the latest Internet security market segment after the explosion of the firewall market?
